      "description": "Enchanted Hut is a place located in Ustrzyki Dolne, next to the Lake Of Mountain Magic. The hut is situated among other cottages that bring with them an amazing atmosphere of old times, as the oldest one was built in the 17th century. But take it easy, the Enchanted Hut is only stylized as old. You will find here all the amenities you need for a comfortable rest. Perfect for nature fans, who are not fans of survival atmosphere.",
